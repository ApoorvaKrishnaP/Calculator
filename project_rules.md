Okay, I've analyzed the provided code review comments and extracted the following coding rules and style guidelines:

1.  **Minimize Comments:** Include only comments that are necessary for understanding the code's purpose or complex logic. Avoid redundant or obvious comments.

2.  **Capitalize Print Statement Sentences:** All sentences within print statements should start with a capital letter. This includes the first word of the sentence and proper nouns.

3.  **Maintain Import Hygiene:** Only import necessary modules and packages. Avoid unused or incorrect imports. Regularly review and clean up import statements.
